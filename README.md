## Overview:
Most ENS holders didn't know that they could do so much more with their .eth names. The basic idea behind ENS-Redirect was to make it easier for users to utilize their ENS names, whether that is by forwarding domains to their social/professional profiles, showing off their work, supporting a cause or just having fun with youtube videos & memes. Since its inception (3 days ago), over 120 users  have already set up redirects on their ENS names (as at Nov 18^th^). As this trend continues, we should expect a noticable increase in contenthash records set over the next few weeks & months. 

## How it works:
- Type in your ENS domain and the web URL you want it to redirect to.
- Sign a message confirming ENS domain ownership.
- ENS Redirect automatically generates and uploads your personal redirect script to IPFS.
- Ethereum transaction is initiated to add the IPFS contenthash to your ENS records.
- Lastly, you can access your website via browsers with native ENS support or append .limo at the end of your ENS domain.
